According to Wikipedia, Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

This program has the following functionalities:

    -Store a secret message inside an image by modifying the color of a given sequence of pixels.
    
    -Store the image inside the project folder so that it can be shared/decrpyted.
    
    -Read an image with (or without) a secret message in it and output the content of the message*.
    
\*In order to propperly read the message, the program needs to know the position of the beggining of the message within the picture and the number of characters in the message.
